From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.Key features:* Forgiving yet challenging gameplay: Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this, Braid is challenging -- but the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.* Rich puzzle environment: Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.* Aesthetic design: A painterly art style and lush, organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay.* Nonlinear story: A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn, your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful "what-if" universes where consequences can be explored.* Nonlinear gameplay: The game doesn't force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed. If you can't figure something out, just play onward and return to that puzzle later.,|,https://lutris.net/games/braid/,|,5,|,%LLGames%/Braid_LLGame/,|,%URLPath%/Braid_v1.0_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,%DBPath%/Braid_v1.0_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/braidllgame.png,|,677,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/braidllgame.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/braidllgame.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,4.5,|,,|,,|,2,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,118852,|,Braid,|,Braid,|,,|,PlatformGame; PuzzleGame; Game;,|,%LLGames%/Braid_LLGame/,|,"%LLGames%/Braid_LLGame/start.sh" "",|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,/home/glenn/LLGames/Braid_LLGame/support/icon.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All-Linux,|,All,|,x86 + x64,|,braidllgame,|,,|,

The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021.In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.Minecraft received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the upcoming Minecraft Legends.,|,https://www.minecraft.net/en-us,|,5,|,%LLGames%/Minecraft_LLGame/,|,%URLPath%/Minecraft.(Linux)_v1.20.4_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,%DBPath%/Minecraft.(Linux)_v1.20.4_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/minecraft(linux)llgame.png,|,682,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/minecraft(linux)llgame.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/minecraft(linux)llgame.png,|,,|,,|,,|,Mojang Studios,|,,|,5,|,,|,,|,1,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,130000,|,Minecraft,|,Vanilla Minecraft,|,,|,OpenWorldGame; Game;,|,%LLGames%/Minecraft_LLGame/,|,start.sh,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,/home/glenn/LLGames/Minecraft_LLGame/LLGame.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All-Linux,|,All,|,x86 + x64,|,minecraft(linux)llgame,|,,|,

The game was originally conceptualized as an isometric game but was later rethought of as an open-world game. The game's art was created by Yoichi Kotabe, and the high-fidelity graphics?designed to include more details than previous games?were created using the Nichimen N-World toolkit. The score was composed by Koji Kondo.Super Mario 64 received critical acclaim and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Reviewers praised its ambition, visuals, gameplay, and music, although some called the camera system unreliable. It is the best-selling Nintendo 64 game, with more than eleven million copies sold by 2003. Numerous developers have cited Super Mario 64 as an influence on 3D platform games, with its dynamic camera system and 360-degree analog control establishing a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for side-scrolling platform games. It was remade as Super Mario 64 DS for the Nintendo DS in 2004, and has been ported to other Nintendo consoles since. The game has attracted a cult following, a large speedrunning presence, and many fangames and rumors surrounding the game have appeared.--------------------------------------Mario 64 on PC is the work of fans reverse engineering the game?s code in 2019. After it was publicly released april 2020, Nintendo immediately started targeting sites hosting the files and getting them taken down. It hasn?t been enough to stop the unofficial port?s continued spread, however, nor modders efforts to continue improving on it. This version supports controllers (With the ability to control the camera view with the 2nd analog stick), Hires textures and wide screen support.Included is the sm64pcbuilder2, which has the ability to download all the developer files to compile it yourself with your choice of texture and model modifications and patches, some allow choosing OpenGL, DX11 or DX12, here is the list of options chosen for this build:Source: sm64ex-alo masterTextures: RESRGAN N64 Faithful--------------------------------------How do I make the game fullscreen?Left Alt + Enter.(Update 5/11)Change fullscreen to true in the config file.How do I change the controls?You can change the codes in the config file.(Update 5/16)You can now change the controls in game via the built in options menu. Pause the game and hit the R button (space then Right Shift if playing with a keyboard). You can also change controls in the config file.Will my controller work?Yes it should work automatically with an Xbox360, Xbox One, PS4, or other Xinput devices. If your controller doesn't work in game but does work on Steam then you can add the game to Steam and launch it that way. If that doesn't work then use Joy2KeyCan I play on Windows 7?Yes, the ones we compile here are the OpenGL version.My game is glitchy or the audio is choppy.You have to cap the framerate currently to 30fps. You do this in either the Nvidia or AMD control pannels. You can also use 3rd party tools like Rivatuner or Afterburner to do this. Or you could change your refresh rate to 30hz (least recommended option).(Update 5/11)You no longer need to cap your framerate.How do I make changes to the new camera controls?Pause the game and hit the R button. You can also make changes in the config file.How do I use the mouse controls?Once youre loaded in game pause and hit the R button on the controller (Space then Right Shift on keyboard).

Xojo uses native controls on each platform so you get a better looking user interface and user experience, plus you'll automatically get the features the Operating System provides, like spell-checking or accessibility. If you're using a language that takes shortcuts and uses non-native controls, that means they are not using the Operating System itself under the hood so your project can't take advantage of those features. Xojo apps will last longer because as the Operating System changes and as features get added, native Xojo apps automatically take advantage of that.Development time can be significantly less when developing with Xojo. In fact, we have heard from Xojo users who built their apps in 20% of the time it took with other tools. How does Xojo help you develop faster? One way is the drag and drop user interface builder. Another is, as opposed to platforms that have thousands of APIs that you need to learn, Xojo abstracts you from the platform details.

It supports all major image file formats, such as JPEG and PNG as well as over 200 raw image formats and can organize collections of photographs in directory-based albums, or dynamic albums by date, timeline, or by tags. Users can also add captions and ratings to their images, search through them and save searches for later use. Using plug-ins, users can export albums to various online services including (among others) 23hq, Facebook, Flickr, Gallery2, Google Earth's KML files, Yandex.Fotki, MediaWiki, Rajce, SmugMug, Piwigo, Simpleviewer, Picasa Web Albums. Plug-ins are also available to enable burning photos to a CD and the creation of web galleries.digiKam provides functions for organizing, previewing, downloading and/or deleting images from digital cameras. Basic auto-transformations can also be deployed on the fly during picture downloading. In addition, digiKam offers image enhancement tools through its KIPI (KDE Image Plugins Interface) framework and its own plugins, like red-eye removal, color management, image filters, or special effects. digiKam was the only free photo management application on Linux that could handle 16 bit/channel images, until RawTherapee version 4.0 was released in 2011, using a new 32 bits/channel engine for all internal image processing. Digital Asset Management is the mainstay of digiKam.digiKam relies on libraries such as exiv2, allowing it to edit XMP metadata embedded in images or separately as sidecar files. It also supports DNG format reading and writing. Marble is also integrated for editing and viewing of geolocations in images.digiKam also efficiently caches image thumbnails and paths in a database, in the PGF format, allowing for quick overviews. There are various database backends to choose from, with scalability and portability considerations taken into account. This database file is independent of photo libraries, enabling remote paths, multiple roots and offline backups.As a non-modal image editor; digiKam's UI also supports live search boxes in both sidebars and the main window.,|,https://www.digikam.org/,|,5,|,%LLApps%/digiKam,|,%URLPath%/digiKam.(AppImage)_v8.7.0_x64_LLApp.tar,|,%DBPath%/digiKam.(AppImage)_v8.7.0_x64_LLApp.tar,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/digikam(appimage)llapp.png,|,702,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/digikam(appimage)llapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/digikam(appimage)llapp.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,4,|,,|,,|,3,|,8.7.0,|,2025-07-14,|,,|,Glenn,|,304000,|,digiKam,|,,|,,|,Photography;,|,%LLApps%/digiKam,|,digiKam-8.7.0-Qt6-x86-64.appimage,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,/home/glenn/LLApps/digiKam/LLApp.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All-Linux,|,All,|,x64,|,digikam(appimage)llapp,|,,|,

It is made by artists that want to see affordable art tools for everyone.Interface:Krita has an intuitive user interface that stays out of your way. The dockers and panels can be moved and customized for your specific workflow. Once you have your setup, you can save it as your own workspace. You can also create your own shortcuts for commonly used tools.Beautiful Brushes:Over 100 professionally made brushes that come preloaded. These brushes give a good range of effects so you can see the variety of brushes that Krita has to offer.Brush Stabilizers:Have a shaky hand? Add a stabilizer to your brush to smoothen it out. Krita includes 3 different ways to smooth and stabilize your brush strokes. There is even a dedicated Dynamic Brush tool where you can add drag and mass.Vector & Text:Built-in vector tools help you create comic panels. Select a word bubble template from the vector library and drag it on your canvas. Change the anchor points to create your own shapes and libraries. Add text to your artwork as well with the text tool. Krita uses SVG to manage its vector format.Brush Engines:Customize your brushes with over 9 unique brush engines. Each engine has a large amount of settings to customize your brush. Each brush engine is made to satisfy a specific need such as the Color Smudge engine, Shape engine, Particle engine, and even a filter engine. Once you are done creating your brushes, you can save them and organize them with Krita's unique tagging system.Wrap-around mode:It is easy to create seamless textures and patterns now. The image will make references of itself along the x and y axis. Continue painting and watch all of the references update instantly. No more clunky offsetting to see how your image repeats itself.Resource Manager:Import brush and texture packs from other artists to expand your tool set. If you create some brushes that you love, share them with the world by creating your own bundles. Check out the brush packs that are available in the Resources area.Simple and Powerful 2D Animation:Turn Krita into an animation studio by switching to the animation workspace. Bring your drawings to life by layering your animations, importing audio, and fine tuning your frames. When you are finished, share with your friends by exporting your creation to a video. Or just export the images to continue working in another application.,|,https://krita.org,|,5,|,%ppApps%/Krita,|,%URLPath%/Krita_v5.2.9_x64_ppApp.apz,|,%DBPath%/Krita_v5.2.9_x64_ppApp.apz,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/kritappapp.png,|,717,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/kritappapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/kritappapp.png,|,,|,keepall keepinfolder,|,Photo|Picture|Designing|Graphics|Drawing|3D,|,Krita Foundation,|,,|,3,|,,|,,|,3,|,5.2.9,|,2025-01-28,|,,|,,|,498382662,|,Krita,|,Krita is an open source painting program made by artists.,|,,|,Graphics Tools;,|,%ppApps%/Krita,|,bin/krita.exe,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All Explorer,|,All,|,x64,|,kritappapp,|,,|,

Itâ€™s a bit of a sneak peek at the direction weâ€™re headed with offline media across the board (including the mobile apps), so check it out and let us know how it works for you!This new app is just called â€œPlexâ€ â€” itâ€™s the macOS and Windows equivalent of our other apps: your window to media greatness (even though this oneâ€™s supercharged with all the same server and library management capabilities of our web app).,|,https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app,|,5,|,%ppApps%/Plex,|,%URLPath%/Plex_v1.108.1.307_x64_ppApp.apz,|,%DBPath%/Plex_v1.108.1.307_x64_ppApp.apz,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/plexppapp.png,|,730,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/plexppapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/plexppapp.png,|,,|,keepall,|,Channel|Streaming|Player|Library|Video,|,Plex,|,,|,5,|,,|,,|,2,|,,|,2025-02-22,|,,|,Glenn,|,408274544,|,Plex,|,Multimedia networked library streamer.,|,,|,Video Playing;,|,%ppApps%/Plex,|,Plex.exe,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,Explorer,|,winget,|,x64,|,plexppapp,|,,|,
