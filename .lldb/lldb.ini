From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.Key features:* Forgiving yet challenging gameplay: Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this, Braid is challenging -- but the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.* Rich puzzle environment: Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.* Aesthetic design: A painterly art style and lush, organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay.* Nonlinear story: A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn, your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful "what-if" universes where consequences can be explored.* Nonlinear gameplay: The game doesn't force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed. If you can't figure something out, just play onward and return to that puzzle later.,|,https://lutris.net/games/braid/,|,5,|,%LLGames%/Braid_LLGame/,|,%URLPath%/Braid_v1.0_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,%DBPath%/Braid_v1.0_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/braidllgame.png,|,670,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/braidllgame.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/braidllgame.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,4.5,|,,|,,|,2,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,118852,|,Braid,|,Braid,|,,|,PlatformGame; PuzzleGame; Game;,|,%LLGames%/Braid_LLGame/,|,"%LLGames%/Braid_LLGame/start.sh" "",|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,/home/glenn/LLGames/Braid_LLGame/support/icon.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All-Linux,|,All,|,x86 + x64,|,braidllgame,|,,|,

The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021.In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.Minecraft received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the upcoming Minecraft Legends.,|,https://www.minecraft.net/en-us,|,5,|,%LLGames%/Minecraft_LLGame/,|,%URLPath%/Minecraft.(Linux)_v1.20.4_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,%DBPath%/Minecraft.(Linux)_v1.20.4_x64+x86_LLGame.tar,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/minecraft(linux)llgame.png,|,675,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/minecraft(linux)llgame.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/minecraft(linux)llgame.png,|,,|,,|,,|,Mojang Studios,|,,|,5,|,,|,,|,1,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,130000,|,Minecraft,|,Vanilla Minecraft,|,,|,OpenWorldGame; Game;,|,%LLGames%/Minecraft_LLGame/,|,start.sh,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,/home/glenn/LLGames/Minecraft_LLGame/LLGame.png,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All-Linux,|,All,|,x86 + x64,|,minecraft(linux)llgame,|,,|,

The game was originally conceptualized as an isometric game but was later rethought of as an open-world game. The game's art was created by Yoichi Kotabe, and the high-fidelity graphics?designed to include more details than previous games?were created using the Nichimen N-World toolkit. The score was composed by Koji Kondo.Super Mario 64 received critical acclaim and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Reviewers praised its ambition, visuals, gameplay, and music, although some called the camera system unreliable. It is the best-selling Nintendo 64 game, with more than eleven million copies sold by 2003. Numerous developers have cited Super Mario 64 as an influence on 3D platform games, with its dynamic camera system and 360-degree analog control establishing a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for side-scrolling platform games. It was remade as Super Mario 64 DS for the Nintendo DS in 2004, and has been ported to other Nintendo consoles since. The game has attracted a cult following, a large speedrunning presence, and many fangames and rumors surrounding the game have appeared.--------------------------------------Mario 64 on PC is the work of fans reverse engineering the game?s code in 2019. After it was publicly released april 2020, Nintendo immediately started targeting sites hosting the files and getting them taken down. It hasn?t been enough to stop the unofficial port?s continued spread, however, nor modders efforts to continue improving on it. This version supports controllers (With the ability to control the camera view with the 2nd analog stick), Hires textures and wide screen support.Included is the sm64pcbuilder2, which has the ability to download all the developer files to compile it yourself with your choice of texture and model modifications and patches, some allow choosing OpenGL, DX11 or DX12, here is the list of options chosen for this build:Source: sm64ex-alo masterTextures: RESRGAN N64 Faithful--------------------------------------How do I make the game fullscreen?Left Alt + Enter.(Update 5/11)Change fullscreen to true in the config file.How do I change the controls?You can change the codes in the config file.(Update 5/16)You can now change the controls in game via the built in options menu.

If your controller doesn't work in game but does work on Steam then you can add the game to Steam and launch it that way. If that doesn't work then use Joy2KeyCan I play on Windows 7?Yes, the ones we compile here are the OpenGL version.My game is glitchy or the audio is choppy.You have to cap the framerate currently to 30fps. You do this in either the Nvidia or AMD control pannels. You can also use 3rd party tools like Rivatuner or Afterburner to do this.

Xojo uses native controls on each platform so you get a better looking user interface and user experience, plus you'll automatically get the features the Operating System provides, like spell-checking or accessibility. If you're using a language that takes shortcuts and uses non-native controls, that means they are not using the Operating System itself under the hood so your project can't take advantage of those features. Xojo apps will last longer because as the Operating System changes and as features get added, native Xojo apps automatically take advantage of that.Development time can be significantly less when developing with Xojo. In fact, we have heard from Xojo users who built their apps in 20% of the time it took with other tools. How does Xojo help you develop faster? One way is the drag and drop user interface builder. Another is, as opposed to platforms that have thousands of APIs that you need to learn, Xojo abstracts you from the platform details.
